### job4j_pooh

#### Description
In this project, we will make an analogue of an asynchronous queue. <br>
The application launches Socket and waits for clients. <br>
Clients can be of two types: senders (publisher), recipients (subscriber).<br>
We will use cURL as a client. <br>
We will use HTTP as the protocol.<br>
